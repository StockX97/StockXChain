# 📈 StockXChain

**StockXChain** is an advanced platform for monitoring and trading tokenized U.S. stocks on-chain, built on the **Solana** blockchain.  
It seamlessly integrates traditional market data with decentralized trading, enabling global users to invest in tokenized Real World Assets (RWAs) like `AAPLx`, `TSLAx`, `AMZNx` — all with near Wall Street-grade tools, but without the barriers of traditional brokerage.
